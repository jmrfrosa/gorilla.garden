welcome

this is a work in progress

server
---
`server` has an [express.js](https://github.com/expressjs/express/) server running the backend, connecting to the database using [knex](https://github.com/knex/knex) as a DB connection layer and [objection](https://github.com/Vincit/objection.js) as an ORM.

start it with
```
yarn start
```

client
---

`client` was bootstrapped with create-react-app to run as a frontend for the server.

start it with
```
yarn start
```
